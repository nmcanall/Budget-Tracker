## Description

The Budget Tracker provides a web application that accepts deposits and withdrawals from an account, tracks the changes in that account, and displays a graph of the overall data.  Budget Tracker thrives in an offline setting through the use of IndexedDB and service workers. Once connections is re-established, Budget Tracker will update MongoDB hosted through Mongo Atlas.
